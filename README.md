# Tic Tac Steak

Welcome to **Tic Tac Steak**! This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python. Despite the name, steak has nothing to do with the game.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the Jupyter Notebook and Run All.
2. **Make Your Move**: Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on the 3x3 grid.
3. **Win the Game**: The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
4. **Draw**: If all nine cells are filled and no player has aligned three marks, the game ends in a draw. (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against another player in the same notebook.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy-to-understand grid layout and input system.
- **Real-time Updates**: The game board updates after each move.
